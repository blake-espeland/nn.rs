# nn.rs
A Rust neural network library.  

**Currently under development**. This is a project where I'm continually iterating as I learn more about rust and its best practices.
As it currently stands, this project is not completed or ready for use.

Feel free to peek around and gain some inspiration.

### TODO
1. Data loading.
2. Finish runtime handling. Includes managing the state of the network at each layer
3. Finish forward pass calculations for each layer.
4. Model architecture that can handle different layer types. (universal Layer struct)
5. Finish backward pass calculations.


### Future
1. Cuda and GPU integration.
2. Inlining functions and optimizations.
3. Transformers, GANs, and stable diffusion models.
