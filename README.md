# nn.rs
A Rust neural network library.  

**Currently under development**. This is a project where I'm continually iterating as I learn more about rust and its best practices.
As it currently stands, this project is not completed or ready for use.

Feel free to peek around and gain some inspiration.

### TODO
1. Finish forward pass calculations for convolution.
2. Finish backward pass calculations for convolution.
3. Implement activation functions on data

### Future
1. Cuda and GPU integration.
2. Inlining functions and optimizations.
3. Transformers, GANs, and stable diffusion models. 
4. Model architecture that can handle different layer types.
5. Different input types.
